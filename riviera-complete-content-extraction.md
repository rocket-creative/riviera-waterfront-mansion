**Tiana & Eric, New York**

"Thank you so much for all the hard work and assistance that you provided us! Your team helped make our day special, smooth && forever memorable! Specifically Tara && Irene were Fantastic!! Thank you!"

**Francielle S, New York**

"Our guests raved about the service, the food (especially the duck and roast suckling pig!), the view of the water, and the beautiful ballroom! My husband and I wanted to include Filipino traditions in our ceremony, and they were happy to work with us! We also had guests with dietary restrictions and allergies, and Irene was happy to make note and accommodate."

**Caroline W, New York**

"I wish there were 10 stars to give because that is truly what this venue deserves. Had my wedding there on 10/10/21 and the entire day was absolutely magical. Top to bottom they were absolutely amazing to work with. From the fantastic views, to the breathtaking bridal suite I was completely blown away. Very professional, easily contacted, guests still raving about the food. Amazing team including Tara and Megan who knew what I needed before I even did."
